# heatmap_image_density_analyser
A simple tool to analyse heatmaps and plot both the percentage density of the Red, Yellow and Green highlighted areas, usually indicating the density of occurance for the measured factor. This allows reverse-engineering of the statistics used to create heatmaps on images that have already been overlayed with the result.
